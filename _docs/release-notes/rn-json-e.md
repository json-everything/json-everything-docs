## Breaking changes

Dropping support for .Net Standard 3.1 - May still be used, but exact behavior cannot be guaranteed. 

## Additions

`JsonNodeExtensions.Clone()` to handle nodes that contain functions, which are not handled properly by `JsonNode.DeepCopy()`.

Updated string indexing to look at text elements instead of chars to better support surrogate pairs.

`$let` operator now errors if `in` is not provided.

Improved error messaging so that it's closer in alignment with other implementations.

Initial release.
