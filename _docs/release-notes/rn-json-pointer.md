[#843](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything/pull/843) - Performance improvements courtesy of [@cptjazz](https://github.com/cptjazz).

# [5.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/822) {#release-pointer-5.1.0}

Add .Net 9.0 support.

# [5.0.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/759) {#release-pointer-5.0.2}

Fixed a problem with `.ToString()` where pointers constructed using `JsonPointer.Create()` would not properly escape segments.

# [5.0.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/757) {#release-pointer-5.0.1}

For some reason v5.0.0 was missing two methods: `.GetAncestor()` and `.GetLocal()`.  This is a republish to include those methods.

# [5.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/719) {#release-pointer-5.0.0}

Complete overhaul of `JsonPointer` to reduce memory usage for consuming applications.

Benchmark showing performance of parsing various pointer strings before and after changes.

## Architecture change

`JsonPointer` now holds the complete pointer string instead of individual segments.  Segments are now exposed via an indexer and return `ReadOnlySpan<char>`s which contain the JSON-Pointer-encoded segment.  Use `JsonPointer.SegmentEquals()` for zero-allocation string comparisons or the `.GetSegmentName()` to decode to a string.

`RelativeJsonPointer` as likewise been updated to a struct.

## Breaking changes

- `JsonPointer` is now a struct.
- `JsonPointer.Segments` removed.
- `JsonPointer.Create(IEnumerable<PointerSegment>)` removed.
- `PointerSegment` is now only an intermediary type for building pointers; non-constructable.
- `RelativeJsonPointer` is now a struct.
- `EnumerableExtensions.GetCollectionHashCode<T>()` removed.

## Additions

- `JsonPointer` segment indexer
- `JsonPointer.SegmentEquals(ReadOnlySpan<char>, string)`
- `JsonPointer.GetAncestor(int)` (gets left part)
- `JsonPointer.GetLocal(int)` (gets right part)
- `NodeExtensions.TryGetSegment()` extension on `JsonObject` to find a key using a JSON-Pointer-encoded char span.
- `SpanExtensions`
  - `GetSegmentName()` decodes a pointer segment char span into a string name
  - `GetSegmentIndex()` decoes a pointer segment char span into an integer index
  - `TryGetInt()` attempts to parse an integer from a char span

# [4.0.1.x](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/712) {#release-pointer-4.0.1.x}

[#711](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/711) - Nuget package meta-data updates; no functional changes from previous version.

# [4.0.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/commit/b065976d62a03166128d8445868e6ab4bc0124d8) {#release-pointer-4.0.1}

Fixed issue with equality operators on `PointerSegment` when dealing with nulls.

# [4.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/619) {#release-pointer-4.0.0}

Updated for multi-framework support with .Net Standard 2.0 and .Net 8 with Native AOT support, including updating _System.Text.Json_ from v6 to v8.

## Breaking changes

- Dropping support for .Net Standard 3.1 - May still be used, but exact behavior cannot be guaranteed.
- `CharExtensions` removed as it was not used.

## Additions

`JsonPointer.TypeInfoResolver` to expose all of the type resolvers contained in the library.  Can be used to create a combined `SerializationOptions` by using a `Json.More.TypeResolverOptionsManager` in your `JsonSerializerContext`.

# [3.3.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/590) {#release-pointer-3.3.0}

[#585](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/585) - Added support for `TypeConverter` so that an application config can properly convert to JSON Pointer in config models.  Thanks to [@wazzamatazz](https://github.com/wazzamatazz) for raising the issue and providing the implementation.

# [3.2.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/576) {#release-pointer-3.2.2}

Implemented support for index modifiers for Relative JSON Pointers (e.g. the `+1` in `0+1/foo`), which apparently just weren't supported.

# [3.2.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/573) {#release-pointer-3.2.1}

[#555](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/555) - JSON Pointer creation using Linq expressions should support using local variables in indexers.  Thanks to [@OmiCron07](https://github.com/OmiCron07) for suggesting.

# [3.2.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/564) {#release-pointer-3.2.0}

[#549](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/549) - Expose JSON converters for all types to support JSON source generation.

# [3.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/509) {#release-pointer-3.1.0}

Enhanced support for creating pointers via Linq expressions.

- Added support for the Linq method `.Last()` to generate a `-` segment which indicates the index beyond the last item in an array.
- Added support for `[JsonPropertyName]` attribute.
- Added support for custom naming transformations.

# [3.0.3](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/509) {#release-pointer-3.0.3}

Improved performance for `JsonPointer.ToString()` by caching the string representation so that it's only generated once.

# [3.0.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/492) {#release-pointer-3.0.2}

Memory and performance improvements.

# [3.0.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/425) {#release-pointer-3.0.1}

[#408](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/408) - Fixed an issue where an empty string segment fails for array values.  Thanks to [@mbj2011](https://github.com/mbj2011) for finding and reporting this.

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/326) {#release-pointer-3.0.0}

Updated model to more correctly represent a basic JSON Pointer.

- URL encoding is merely a formatting concern
- Removed `UrlEmpty`
- `Parse()` and `TryParse()` are still tolerant of URL encoded pointers and will decode automatically
- Removed `Source` property as `ToString()` is the default method for getting a string
- Renamed `JsonPointerKind` to `JsonPointerStyle` to reflect the formatting nature of its purpose
- Added `ToString(JsonPointerKind)` to support outputting in URL encoded format

Added implicit cast from `int` to `PointerSegment`.  Previously, only a cast from `uint` existed, but typing `int`s is easier.

# 2.2.1 (no PR) {#release-pointer-2.2.1}

[#288](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/288) - Just bumping version to allow dependent packages to pick up the latest Json.More.Net by default, which is transitively pulled via this package.

# [2.2.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/243) {#release-pointer-2.2.0}

Updated System.Text.Json to version 6 in order to add `JsonNode` support.

The API is shaped a bit differently for `JsonNode` than the existing API for `JsonElement`.  Specifically, it exposes

```c#
bool TryEvaluate(JsonNode node, out JsonNode? result)
```

instead of the `Evaluate()` call you've all come to know and love.

This is because .Net decided to do a [silly thing](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/66948#issuecomment-1080148457) and represent JSON null using .Net null.  This decision means that a null returned here cannot be distinguished between not existing and existing with a value of JSON null.

`RelativeJsonPointer` is now implemented! ...for `JsonNode`.

# [2.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/185) {#release-pointer-2.1.0}

[#184](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/184) - [@JanKnipp](https://github.com/JanKnipp) added array (e.g. `int[]`) support to Linq expression construction of pointers.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/179) {#release-pointer-2.00}

[#171](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/171) - Updated `JsonPointer`, `PointerSegment`, and `RelativeJsonPointer` from struct to class since it holds by-reference data anyway.  Removes parameterless constructor for these types.  These changes make them better immutable models.

# [1.4.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/162) {#release-pointer-1.4.0}

- Added implicit casts from `int` and `string` to `PointerSegment`
- Added params overload for `JsonPointer.Create()`.

# [1.3.3](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/130) {#release-pointer-1.3.3}

[#123](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/123) - Removed a copy/paste error that shows up while deserializing relative pointers.  Thanks to [@bastiaantenklooster](https://github.com/bastiaantenklooster) for finding this and creating a PR to fix it.

# [1.3.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/75) {#release-pointer-1.3.2}

Added support for nullable reference types.

# [1.3.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/61) {#release-pointer-1.3.1}

Signed the DLL for strong name compatibility.

# [1.3.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/58) {#release-pointer-1.3.0}

Added support pointer creation using lambda expressions, e.g. `x => x.foo[5].bar` to create `/foo/5/bar`.

# [1.2.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/52) {#release-pointer-1.2.0}

Added support for array index manipulation in Relative JSON Pointer 2 (spec updated alongside JSON Schema Draft 2020-12).

# [1.1.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/45) {#release-pointer-1.1.2}

Added debug symbols to package.  No functional change.

# [1.1.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/12) {#release-pointer-1.1.1}

Updated reference to Json.More<nsp>.Net.

# [1.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/7) {#release-pointer-1.1.0}

Added `JsonPointerKind` enumeration.

Added `JsonPointer.Kind` property.

Added optional parameters to `JsonPointer.Parse()` and `JsonPointer.TryParse()`.

# 1.0.0 {#release-pointer-1.0.0}

Initial release.
